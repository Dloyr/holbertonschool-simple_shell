.SH NAME

.B hsh
- command line interpreter or shell

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B  ./hsh
.I executable

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhsh\fR, a tailored version of a fundamental UNIX shell, characterized by a minimalist approach in both its design and development. Its main objective is to offer only the indispensable features of a shell, taking inspiration from the framework created by Ken Thompson. The design, compilation, and testing processes were conducted in an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.

.SH OVERVIEW
In a same way as other command-line interfaces, hsh accepts commands from either the terminal or scripts, both directly and indirectly (via a pipe), and executes them in the order they are presented.

.SH INVOCATION
Use the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) for compiling hsh with extra flags as shown:

.P
.RS
.B $ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
.P
.RE
.B - Interactive mode:

.RS
the Simple Shell works by taking user input on the terminal after pressing the enter key. Note that the prompt ($) will appear and you will then be in interactive mode and able to enter commands followed by "enter."
.RE

.P
.RS
.B ($) ./hsh
.P
.RE

.SH INSTALLATION
.I To install:
.br

.B git clone (git@github.com:Dloyr/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git)
.br

.B - Non-interactive mode:

.RSS
Users can specify shell scripts to be executed by Simple Shell usually through the use of pipes '|'.
.RE

.P
.RS
.B ($) echo "ls -l" | ./hsh
.RE

.SH EXECUTABLES
If the first character of the command is a slash (/), the shell search for it in the list of shell builtins.
If there exists a shell builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.

.RS
.B ($) /bin/pwd
.br
.B \&/workspaces/holbertonschool-simple_shell
.br
.B ($)
.RE

If not then the shell will search in the user PATH environment if the command exist.

.RS
.B ($) pwd
.br
.B \&/workspaces/holbertonschool-simple_shell
.br
.B \&($)
.RE
